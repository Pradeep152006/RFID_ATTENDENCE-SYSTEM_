 How It Works
  

The user taps their RFID card near the reader.

The ESP8266 reads the card UID and checks it against pre-registered IDs.

The OLED display shows the user’s name and confirmation message.

The ESP8266 sends data (Name, UID, Timestamp) to Google Sheets using a web app script.

Attendance data is automatically stored and viewable in Google Sheets from anywhere.
